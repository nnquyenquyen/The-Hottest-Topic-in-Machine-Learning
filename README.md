# Python Project: The Hottest Topic in Machine Learning
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) on [Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_on_Neural_Information_Processing_Systems) papers to uncover the trendiest topics in Machine Learning research.

## Key Objectives:
1. Data preprocessing to build a NLP model
2. Word Cloud visualization
3. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) analysis
